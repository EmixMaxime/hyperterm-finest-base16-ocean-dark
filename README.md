# The very finest Hyperterm Base16 Ocean Dark theme

Inspired by the Spacegray dark theme by @mxstbr. The name is a joke -- I actually just built this theme for fun and thought I'd share it. Then I saw there were already two other versions... so I needed a cheeky name!

## Installation

  2. Add `hyperterm-finest-base16-ocean-dark` to your plugins array like so:
